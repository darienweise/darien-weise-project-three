They tell the player that they took the player in after their parents died, and that if the player doesn't pick up the slack then they will toss them on the streets. They ask the player to say "Yes" if they understand.
// the player is presented with a prompt to say yes or to say no. 
// if the player says no, then the image of the cold outdoors pops up with an alert that says - "Game over"
// else the two owners tell the player to make 100 gingerbread men and tell the player when they finish their first batch, to call them over and they will try the cookie to be certain the player made it correctly. The owners then leave.
